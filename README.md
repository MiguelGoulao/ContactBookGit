This is a starter kit for the first lab of the Software Engineering Course.
Fork this project to make your own version of it.

You will notice some things need to be updated in this code. It was originally made with Java 8 and JUnit 4. The plan is for you to still use JUnit 4, but you can and should use a more recent version, like Java 21. You may also note a few other redundant things (e.g. imports). Fix whatever you need to.
