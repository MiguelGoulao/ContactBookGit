This is a starter kit for the first lab of the Software Engineering Course.

You will notice some things need to be updated in this code. It was originally made with Java 8 and JUnit 4. The plan is for you to still use JUnit 4, but you can and should use a more recent version, like Java 21. You may also note a few other redundant things (e.g. imports). Fix whatever you need to.
